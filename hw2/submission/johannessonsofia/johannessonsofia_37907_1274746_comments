clarification of homework

question 1.e
As the graph of rates shows the rates of 
earthquakes seems to go above historic levels at around 2010, 
and reaching really high levels around 2015. The rate started
to decrease again after 2015. It is probably due to the fluid 
injection wells.

question 2.c
I choose to measure the area of the area of superdense earthquake-
activity (the top blob). This area is appriximately 25900 km^2
 which is 14% of the area of Oklahoma.
